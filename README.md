Bindings generated with [C# GDExtension Bindgen](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-csharp-gdextension-bindgen)

# Supported Versions
Wwise 2024.1.8
Godot 4.3, 4.4, 4.5

# Installation
1. Follow the installation instructions for the [Wwise Godot Integration](https://github.com/alessandrofama/wwise-godot-integration) by Alessandro Fama
2. Add all files from the according Wwise and Godot versions found in [Releases](https://github.com/Mikagino/Wwise-Godot-Integration-CS-Bindings/releases) to res://addons
3. Build your project
4. Works!

# Usage
You can use most of the features described in the [Wwise Godot Integration](https://github.com/alessandrofama/wwise-godot-integration/wiki). Some features are still not working (like exporting Events and Soundbanks for assigning in the editor) but I might add them in the future.

## Wwise ID's
The wwise_ids.gd generated by Famas Plugin can be converted to C# by the plugin _WwiseIdsConverter_ (you need to build the project and then you can enable it in the project settings). After installation you should see the tab _WwiseIdsConverter_ on the bottom left. Upon clicking _Convert_ in that tab the WwiseIds will be generated into WwiseIds.cs. The ID's can be accessed via the AKCS namespace and from there the normal paths like in Famas plugin.

# To-Do's
- [x] Check if update to Wwise 2025.1.3 with Godot 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 requires any changes
- [ ] Copy Alessandro's documentation
- [x] Parse wwise_ids.gd
- [ ] Parse various Wwise Objects for usage in Editor
